# Bug-Detection-and-Error-Fixing
Build a machine learning model that can automatically identify bugs (or potential errors) in a given piece of code and suggest fixes. This project requires designing, training, and evaluating an ML model that can parse source code, classify bug types, and generate fix recommendations.
